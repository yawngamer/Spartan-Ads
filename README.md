# Spartan-Ads

What if... all iTeam services had ads?

If you want to test this, go to http://ads.lciteam.club/. It pulls from github every 30 seconds, so any commits show up almost immediately.

You can also download all the files, put them in a folder, and open index.html. This works on chromebook.

This only kinda works tho. If you want all features to work, download this chrome app and use it to host.
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/web%20server%20for%20chrome

Note: the button won't display unless you host the website, and the actual sign-in won't work unless you use the whitelisted domain (ads.lciteam.club)
